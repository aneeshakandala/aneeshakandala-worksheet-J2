## 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?

int a; --> basic type

double b; --> basic type 

int c[] = {1, 2, 3}; --> object

String s = "Hello World"; --> object

## 2. Two part question
- (A) What is a static method in Java?

A static method in java is a method that belongs to the class instead of an object. 

- (B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?

The main method needs to be static so that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. 

## 3. What is the output of the following programs?
- Program 1 - "Wrong"
- Program 2 - "Correct" 

## 4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
No, the program below does not change the season. The string ```str``` only exists within the static method change_season, 
meaning that when, in the main method, season is printed, the string within main, ```season```, is printed.  

## 5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
The output of the function would be "X: 0.0 Y: 0.0". This is because x and y are local variables that do not have their value changed in the main method because
because there is no ```this``` key word that assigns the parameters to the instance variables. 

## 6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
It maintains the priciple of information hiding and encapsulation. If the variable/function decalaration is private, then people outside of the point class can not access the variable/function. 

## 7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
The first one is chosen, the double double, because FINISH.

## 8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:

Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis:

Which of the following implementations achieves this? Explain why. 


## 9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint and run this program, what is the output?


## 10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?


## 11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation). Explain your answer. 


## 12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
The point of the protected modifier is to ______


## 13. Consider the following class. Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.
```
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;
    //TODO
  public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make){
    super(n, d);
    this.make = make;
}

  public String toString(){
    return super.toString() + "" + make;
}
```

## 14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than either of those, does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.


## 15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the UML diagram?

(Include your UML diagram and explanation below in this markdown file.)
