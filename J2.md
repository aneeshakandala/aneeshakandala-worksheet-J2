## 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?

int a; --> basic type

double b; --> basic type 

int c[] = {1, 2, 3}; --> object

String s = "Hello World"; --> object

## 2. Two part question
- (A) What is a static method in Java?

A static method in java is a method that belongs to the class instead of an object. 

- (B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?

The main method needs to be static so that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. 

## 3. What is the output of the following programs?
- Program 1 - "Wrong"
- Program 2 - "Correct" 

## 4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
No, the program below does not change the season. The string ```str``` only exists within the static method change_season, 
meaning that when, in the main method, season is printed, the string within main, ```season```, is printed.  

## 5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
The output of the function would be "X: 0.0 Y: 0.0". This is because x and y are local variables that do not have their value changed in the main method because
because there is no ```this``` key word that assigns the parameters to the instance variables. 

## 6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
It maintains the priciple of information hiding and encapsulation. If the variable/function decalaration is private, then people outside of the point class can not access the variable/function. 

## 7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
Java chooses between the two consturctors based on the number of arguments passed when a Point object is created. If two doubles were passed, then the first one would be used, but when another Point object is passed the second would then be used.  

## 8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described. Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis. Which of the following implementations achieves this? Explain why. 
The implementation showcased in option 4 is the correct answer. Option 4 is the only option that utilizes getX, getY, and setXY methods to access private variables x and y. 

## 9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint and run this program, what is the output?
The code will not compile and would instead produce an error because super() is not the first statement to be declared in the function. Since it uses the constuctor of a parent class, the super() should be the first line of code. 

## 10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?
Switching the lines will allow for the code to compile without errors, since now the super() line of code would be first.

## 11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation). Explain your answer. 
The implementations in options 1 and 2 are valid. Option 1 calls on reflect via this.reflect(), then returns super.sum_x_y() to return the sum of x and y. This overrides sum_x_y because it calls on the parent class method. Option 2 is also valid because it also calls on reflect via this.reflect() and sums x and y in the return statement itself instead of using the parent class. This option overrides sum_x_y because it uses the this keyword for this.x and this.y . The other options, options 3 and 4, would not work because they do not have the same method signature, meaning that these options would not override the original method. 


## 12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
The point of the protected modifier is to restrict access to outside classes that are not related through inheritance but allows for a class to access constructors, fields, and methods from subclasses and classes within the same package. This works in terms in terms of inheritance since subclasses are able to inherit access due to be in the same package or parent class, whereas classes that are unrelated to the parent class are denied visibility. 


## 13. Consider the following class. Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.
```
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;
    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make){
        super(n, d);
        this.make = make;
    }

  public String toString(){
    return super.toString() + "" + make;
    }
}
```

## 14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than either of those, does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.
Neither A nor B will work. We are calling on addSponser outside of the protected keyword associated with it, so there will be no way to access this method since the main method is outside of the inheritance key and does not allow for protected methods to be called. 

## 15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the UML diagram?
Explanation: Intern and Manager are subclasses of Employee, indicated through the "inheritance" arrow. Additionally, Intern belongs to Manager and Unit because Manager and Unit have an association with Employee.
